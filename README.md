## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this notifications page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While making this project, I had a lot of fun and it also required critical thinking. I learned how to use the HTML classList 
DOM object and how to use some of it's classes like 
    - `remove()`
    - `add()`
    - `toggle()`

Like so: 
```js
not1.classList.add('unread')
    not3.classList.add('unread')
    not2.classList.add('unread')
```

### Continued development

While building future projects, I hope to work more with HTML DOM elements
